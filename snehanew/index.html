                        1976 was an eventful year in the history of Kasarkod, a sleepy fishing village on the south bank
                        of
                        Sharavathi estuary, on the silver sands of the Arabian Sea beach. An unassuming
                        lady Dr. Kusuma Sorab stepped into Kasarkod with the mission of providing health services
                        especially
                        to the village communities in the Sharavathi Valley, for most of whom the
                        Government Hospital in Honavar, over-crowded always, was otherwise the main refuge in crisis. To
                        realize her mission of medical and social service to the poor Dr. Kusuma, a post-
                        graduate in medicine and surgery, left the bustling metropolitan city of Mumbai, preferring the
                        peace of Kasarkod, its silence broken only by the sound of sea waves and of the west
                        wind whistling through the boxwood groves rendering a unique charm to it. Thus was born the
                        Snehakunja Trust, an ashram of refuge for people in distress, more so for scores of
                        village women.</p>

                    <p>
                        The Trust with the support of like minded persons, under the leadership of Dr. Kusuma,
                        established
                        the Vivekananda Arogya Dhama Dhama for providing health services to the
                        poor.Soon Dr. Kusuma realized that the health problems of the poor is more related to the
                        economic
                        and community dimensions, which led to the development of a comprehensive
                        social development model action plan focusing on community health, rural development and
                        environmental advocacy. Dr. Kusuma trained young women on the formation of
                        independent groups to make themselves self-reliant. Dr. Kusuma was an apostle of environment and
                        believed strongly that mismanagement of ecological systems is a major
                        cause for maladies of the modern world. She focused on eradication of superstition and
                        illiteracy,
                        organized local communities to protect the environment. During the upward cycle
                        of movement her life was extinguished tragically in a road accident!</p>

                    <p>
                        The mission continued nevertheless with Snehakunja Trust leading in constituting womenâ€™s
                        self-help
                        groups, in public health care relying mainly on the traditional Ayurveda and
                        nature care, organic farming, in constituting village forest committees for co-management of
                        forests
                        with support from the Forest Department and many social and environmental
                        action oriented work involving the communities and establishing links with other regional civil
                        society groups.</p>
